## Usage

- Export capabilities for compliance and reporting

### Impersonating Users

1. Go to the Users section in the admin panel
2. Click "Impersonate" next to any user
3. A banner will appear showing you're impersonating
4. Click "Stop Impersonating" to return to your admin session

### Managing Feature Flags

1. Visit the Feature Flags section
2. Toggle features on/off for different environments
3. Set up user-specific feature access

## Activity Tracking

To track activities for your models, include the `ActivityTrackable` concern:

```ruby
class YourModel < ApplicationRecord
  include ActivityTrackable
  
  # Override these methods to customize activity tracking
  private
  
  def activity_user
    # Return the user who performed the action
    current_user
  end
  
  def activity_workspace
    # Return the associated workspace
    self.workspace
  end
  
  def create_activity_description
    "Created #{self.class.name.humanize.downcase}: #{self.name}"
  end
end
```

You can also manually log activities:

```ruby
UserActivity.log_user_activity(
  user: current_user,
  action: 'subscription_created',
  description: 'Upgraded to Pro plan',
  resource: subscription,
  workspace: current_workspace,
  metadata: { plan: 'pro', amount: 29.99 }
)
```

## Security

- **Role-based access:** Only authorized admin users can access the panel
- **Session management:** Secure impersonation with automatic timeouts
- **Audit trail:** All admin actions are logged for accountability
- **Activity isolation:** Users can only see their own activities
