# Contributing to Rails SaaS Starter Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project follows a **Fairware** model - it's free to use, but we welcome both financial and non-financial contributions.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### üí∞ Financial Support
If you find this project valuable, consider supporting development:
- **[Pay What You Want](https://mitchell.fyi)** - Direct contributions
- **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mitchellfyi)** - Monthly support
- See [SUPPORT.md](docs/SUPPORT.md) for detailed information

### üõ†Ô∏è Code Contributions
Even without financial support, code contributions are welcome!

#### Getting Started
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** your changes thoroughly
6. **Commit** with clear messages
7. **Push** to your fork
8. **Open** a Pull Request

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mitchellfyi/railsplan.git
cd railsplan

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Setup the database
bin/rails db:setup

# Run tests
bin/rails test
bin/railsplan test

# Check code quality
bundle exec rubocop
```

#### Running the Marketing Site Locally
This project includes a marketing website that showcases the Rails SaaS Starter Template. To run it locally:

```bash
# Start the Rails server
bin/rails server

# Visit the site at http://localhost:3000
```

**If port 3000 is in use, use a different port:**
```bash
# Use port 3001
bin/rails server -p 3001

# Or let Rails choose an available port
bin/rails server -p 0
```

**Marketing Site Features:**
- **Homepage** (`/`) - Overview and getting started
- **Documentation** (`/docs`) - Comprehensive guides and API docs
- **Modules** (`/docs/modules`) - Detailed module documentation
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`) - Admin interface (if admin module is installed)

**Development Tips:**
- The site uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Check `app/views/home/` for homepage content
- Check `app/views/docs/` for documentation pages
- Check `app/helpers/home_helper.rb` for dynamic content
- The site is fully responsive and accessible

**Testing the Marketing Site:**
```bash
# Run accessibility tests
bin/rails test test/accessibility_test.rb

# Run integration tests
bin/rails test test/integration/

# Check for broken links
bin/rails test test/controllers/
```

#### Gem Development
This project includes both a Rails application and a Ruby gem. To work on the gem:

```bash
# Build the gem
gem build railsplan.gemspec

# Install locally for testing
gem install ./railsplan-0.1.0.gem

# Test gem functionality
railsplan version
railsplan doctor

# Run gem tests
bundle exec rspec

# Uninstall local gem
gem uninstall railsplan
```

**Gem Structure:**
- `lib/railsplan/` - Core gem library
- `bin/railsplan` - CLI executable
- `templates/` - Gem templates
- `railsplan.gemspec` - Gem specification

#### Project Structure
This is a **hybrid project** that serves both as:
1. **Rails SaaS Starter Template** - A complete Rails application with marketing site
2. **RailsPlan Gem** - A global CLI tool for Rails SaaS bootstrapping

**Key Directories:**
- `app/` - Rails application (marketing site, admin panel)
- `lib/railsplan/` - Ruby gem library
- `scaffold/` - Template files for generated applications
- `docs/` - Documentation for the template
- `test/` - Tests for both Rails app and gem

**Development Workflow:**
- **Rails App**: Work on the marketing site, admin panel, and template features
- **Gem**: Work on the CLI commands and gem functionality
- **Template**: Work on the scaffold files that get copied to new applications

#### Common Development Tasks

**Working on the Marketing Site:**
```bash
# Start the development server
bin/rails server

# View the site at http://localhost:3000
# Edit files in app/views/, app/controllers/, app/helpers/
```

**Working on the CLI Gem:**
```bash
# Test CLI commands
bin/railsplan help
bin/railsplan list
bin/railsplan doctor

# Run CLI tests
bin/rails test test/railsplan_cli_test.rb

# Build and install gem for testing
gem build railsplan.gemspec
gem install ./railsplan-0.1.0.gem
```

**Working on Template Files:**
```bash
# Test template generation
bin/test-template

# Edit template files in scaffold/
# Test module installation
bin/railsplan add <module_name>
```

**Testing Everything:**
```bash
# Run all tests
bin/rails test

# Run specific test suites
bin/rails test test/railsplan_cli_test.rb
bin/rails test test/integration/
bin/rails test test/accessibility_test.rb

# Check code quality
bundle exec rubocop
```
